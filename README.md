# ISP_SPOOKY_FREAK_THEM_OFF 🤺⛷️🔫🏂🌪️🤿🪂⛷️🔫

**Purpose:**  
This script is designed to overwhelm any nosy ISPs addicted to spying on your online activity. By opening random, harmless yet wild URLs from a provided list (`Spooky.txt`), it creates a digital smokescreen to obscure your real browsing habits. Think of it as a digital prank on the snoops.

---

## How It Works
1. **Random Link Opener**: Picks links from a file (`Spooky.txt`) and opens them in your default browser at random intervals.
2. **Multi-threaded Madness**: Multiple threads ensure maximum chaos by opening multiple links simultaneously.
3. **Endless Action**: The script runs indefinitely until manually stopped.

## Setup Instructions
